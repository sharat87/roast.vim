USAGE                                                            *roast*

Open (or create) a file with the extension of `.http` or `.roast` and the roast
plugin will be active in that buffer. Now put the following text in that file
and hit the <Enter> key while the cursor is on that line:
>
   GET http://httpbin.org/get answer=42
<
The output of this `GET` request should show up in a new vertically split
window. The line itself should highlight in a shade of green. If the request
was a failure, you'd see that the line would highlight in a shade red.


FEATURES OVERVIEW                                               *roast-features*

- Syntax roughly similar to HTTP protocol requests.
- Headers apply to all requests below that header definition line.
- A single session is used for all requests from a buffer. That is, cookies are
  preserved across requests from a single buffer.
- Simple string variables support that can be used for interpolation.
- Variable interpolation is implemented with Python's `.format` syntax.
- Variable interpolation works in request paths, query params, header values,
  request bodies, other variable definitions.
- Each line is parsed with Python's `shlex` module. That is, comments start with
  `#`, quotes should be used to specify strings with special characters such as
  spaces.

A good place to find working examples would be the `python3/test_roast.py`
module where several of the above features are tested.


HEADERS                                                         *roast-headers*

The syntax for setting headers is similar to how they appear in an actual HTTP
request.
>
   Accept: application/json
<
This line will ensure that this header is set to all requests that are below
this line. For example, consider the following file:
>
   GET /url/path/1
   Accept: application/json
   GET /url/path/2
<
If you place the cursor on the request for `/url/path/1` and hit <Enter>, the
`Accept` header is not sent. If, however, you place the cursor on the request
for `/url/path/2` and hit <Enter>, the header is sent. The header is sent for
any and all requests below `/url/path/2` as well.

The header can be given a different value somewhere down and that will be
effective from that point on in the file.

To remove the header, set the header with no value. Like:
>
   Accept:
<
No `Accept` header will be sent on the following requests.


DIRECTIVES                                        *roast-directives* *roast-use*

Roast has `use` directives that configure the behaviour of Roast. Currently,
there only one directive that can be used with `use`:

URL Prefix:                                                   *roast-url_prefix*
>
    use url_prefix https://httpbin.org
<

After this line, a request like `GET /url` would actually run a GET request to
`https://httpbin.org/url`. The value given to `url_prefix` can contain path
elements as well.

To unset the `url_prefix`, don't provide a value, just like for headers. Like
this:

>
    use url_prefix
<


REQUEST QUERY PARAMS

Query parameters can be given as part of the URL in the usual fashion,
>
   GET http://httpbin.org/get?key1=value1&key2=value2
<
Note that the URL is processed with python's `.format` with |roast-variables|
so variable interpolation can be used here.

But it is usually more convenient to use spaces that roast.vim allows instead
of the `&` and `?` marks. The above can be written as:
>
   GET http://httpbin.org/get key1=value1 key2=value2
<
In this form, only the values support interpolation. For example,
>
   set answer 42
   GET http://httpbin.org/get text=number_{answer}
<
This sends a request to the following URL:
>
   http://httpbin.org/get?text=number_42
<
There's also a shortcut for the following common use case:
>
   set answer 42
   GET http://httpbin.org/get answer={answer}
<
This can be written as:
>
   set answer 42
   GET http://httpbin.org/get answer
<
Both send request to the following URL:
>
   http://httpbin.org/get?answer=42
<


REQUEST BODY                                                *roast-post-body*

The body for POST or other requests can be specified using heredoc-like syntax.
This is best illustrated with an example:
>
   POST http://httpbin.org/post << body
   here goes the post body
   this content is passed to the POST request as-is.
   body
<
The heredoc marker is `body` here. It can be any alphanumeric string.

Mark the heredoc as `RAW` to avoid any variable interpolation:

>
  POST http://httpbin.org/post << RAW
  {
    "username": "Sherlock",
    "password": "Moriarty"
  }
  RAW
<

The verbatim JSON string will be sent as body.

Mark the heredoc as `JINJA2` to render the body with the jinja2 template:

>
   set name Sherlock
   set password Moriarty
   POST http://httpbin.org/post << JINJA2
   {
     "username": "{{name}}",
     "password": "{{password}}"
   }
   JINJA2
<

Note that the `jinja2` package needs to be installed to use this feature.

The variables will be used to render the body and the final body would be
like:

>
  {
    "username": "Sherlock",
    "password": "Moriarty"
  }
<

USING VARIABLES                                             *roast-variables*

Variables allow for interpolation within braces and this lets us create nice
little DSL's made up of HTTP APIs.

The syntax to set a variable is as following:
>
   set name value
<
If the value contains spaces or special characters, it can be surrounded by
quotes, similar to escaping semantics of a shell. Note the variable
interpolations are allowed in the value part of this syntax.

Variable interpolations are powered by Python's `str.format` method. If you're
not familiar with that method, don't worry, here's what it looks like:
>
   set first_name Elijah
   set last_name Baley
   set full_name {first_name}_{last_name}
<
The variable `full_name` will be set to `Elijah_Baley`.

Variable interpolations work in header values, URL's, query parameter values and
other variable declarations. A variable can be set to a different value with the
same file. Only the closest `set` above the current line will be taken into
consideration.

A neat shortcut regarding interpolation in query params is that it is possible
to use params already set for interpolation in later params, with the name
prefixed with the `@` symbol. That doesn't make sense, I know, but an example
will click right away. Here it is:
>
  GET https://httpbin.org/get first=Jon last=Snow full={@first}_{@last}
<
Get it now? :)

A note about escaping braces in the context of interpolation. Braced should be
doubled to escape. So, if we are defining a variable with a JSON value, the
braces should be doubled so they won't be interpreted as interpolation targets.
<
   set payload '{{"username": "Sherlock", "password": "Moriarty"}}'
>
Here, the variable `payload` would be set to the following text:
<
   {"username": "Sherlock", "password": "Moriarty"}
>
This is covered in the test `test_variable_with_json_value`.


VIEWING RESPONSE                                       *roast-viewing-response*

When a request is run (by hitting the <Enter> key, by default), a new window is
opened by splitting vertically, unless a window is already displaying a roast
result.

This window will show the response of the query with json syntax highlighting if
the appropriate response header is present.

To view other details of the request/response, go to the window displaying a the
result and hit <C-j> or <C-k> to cycle between several renderers of the response
data.

There is a provision for custom renderers, but it's not mature enough to be
documented and encouraged in the wild. Coming soon.


TIPS                                                           *roast-tips*

1. Switch the `url_prefix` between various staging servers of your app.

For example, if we have http://dev.staging.example.com/ as our dev server and
http://qa.staging.example.com/ as our QA server, we can set the `url_prefix` in
our roast file in the first line like:
>
   use url_prefix http://dev.staging.example.com/
<
With this, we can have a hotkey to switch this host between dev and QA hosts.
This can be achieved with something like the following (to be put in
~/.vim/after/ftplugin/roast.vim):

>
py3 import vim
nnoremap <silent> <buffer> <LoacalLeader>d :py3 vim.current.buffer[0] = 'use url_prefix http://dev.staging.example.com/'
nnoremap <silent> <buffer> <LoacalLeader>q :py3 vim.current.buffer[0] = 'use url_prefix http://qa.staging.example.com/'
<

Of course, this is very basic, it assumes the `url_prefix` directive is on the
first line or overwrites that line when the hotkey is hit.


More tips coming soon!
