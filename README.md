ðŸš¨ I'm working an in-browser version of an idea roughly similar to this plugin. Please check out [Prestige](https://prestigemad.com), which is also [open source](https://github.com/sharat87/prestige).

# roast.vim<sup>&beta;</sup>

An http client as a ViM editor plugin. Utilizes the `+python3` feature. Not tested on Neovim. Known to work on ViM 8.1.

A 2&half; minutes video demo (no audio): <https://youtu.be/W2QKvJvR3dY>.

Full docs in ViM format: [doc/roast.txt](https://github.com/sharat87/roast.vim/blob/master/doc/roast.txt).

## Run tests

Go to the python3 directory and run `pytest .`, with Python 3.6 at least.

## Inspiration / Alternatives

If you don't like this, or are looking for more http clients on ViM, here's a few options:

1. [baverman/vial-http](https://github.com/baverman/vial-http) - Also built on Python.
2. [diepm/vim-rest-console](https://github.com/diepm/vim-rest-console) - Powered by curl.
3. [aquach/vim-http-client](https://github.com/aquach/vim-http-client) - Also Python + requests.
